#This a short version of the Stroop experiment. 
#The experiement has no time constraints whereby the participant has as much time to answer. 
#The participant is required to hit the key on the keyboard that corresponds to the first letter of the colour that the physical word is
#in NOT the name of the colour that is printed. 
#The participant can only hit one of the four keys to proceed to the next round (either: r,g,b,y corresponding to red, green, blue, and yellow).
#This experiment is designed for geriatrics because they are able to move at their own pace.
